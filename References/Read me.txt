Pull a variety of financial data such as balance sheet or income statement data. 

Suppose you want to assess year over year financial growth for a group of stocks.

We need to create a function that pulls data from a companyâ€™s income statement and then calculates a yearly change for: 
-revenue, 
-net income, 
-earning per share growth, and 
-EBITDA growth.

# Fintech-Project
## Proposal:

The focus of the project is to integrate Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) into equity investment analysis and use Key Performance Indicators (KPIâ€™s) to evaluate their ratings. We will summarize the stock pricing data, annual reports, and corporate governance policies as they align with global environmental goals for environmental and social sustainability in our analysis.
